# DH conferences CFP

Call for papers of recent ADHO DH conferences, here collected in English and French
* to prepare the next French translation
* to test a (collaborative) GitHub workflow that could be used to archive the calls and make the various versions easier to produce and more coherent

## Caveat

The Markdown formatting of the CFPs is a quick, semi-automatic attempt at uniformising documents originally in various formats. It should be refined, and texts should be aligned, for a `diff` to be fully efficient.
