# DH conferences CFP

The calls for papers of recent [ADHO](http://adho.org/) Digital Humanities conferences (2015-) are here collected in English and French:
* to prepare the annual French translation as a contribution of [Humanistica](http://www.humanisti.ca);
* to test a (collaborative) GitHub workflow that could be used to archive the calls and make the various versions easier to produce and more coherent.

## Caveat

The Markdown formatting of the CFPs is a quick, semi-automatic attempt at uniformising documents originally in various formats. It should be refined, and texts should be aligned, for a `diff` to be fully efficient.
